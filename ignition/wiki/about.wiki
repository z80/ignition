Ignition is a space flight simulation game.

The game is a sandbox game and is open ended. As a player you are expected to build rockets and explore the solar system.

The game itself is capable of simulating real size planets and solar systems. However, in order to make it easier to play, planets and solar system are reduced in size to make space flight times more manageable. Typical planet orbital periods are days instead of years like in our real solar system.

In the game planets and moons follow perfect Kepler orbits. When in space your rocket normally flies along elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic orbit. It is assumed that only the closest planet (moon or star) affects the orbit, influences from distant planets are ignored (for now). 

In special cases, when Kepler equations degenerate, rocket trajectory is computed using [i]Kunge-Kutta 4-th order[/i] numerical integration.
