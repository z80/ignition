## Synopsis

This project provides a new implementation of our [Precomputed Atmospheric
Scattering](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00288758/en) paper. This new
implementation uses more descriptive function and variable names, adds
extensive comments and documentation, unit tests, and more. See the [full
documentation](https://ebruneton.github.io/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/)
for more details, as well as the [online
demo](https://ebruneton.github.io/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/demo.html).
