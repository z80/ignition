- [ ] Object placement is very annoying and poor, need drag & drop like KSP (this is very very needed ASAP almost before anything else).
- [ ] Astronaut doesn't auto face way it moves, quite cosmetic but annoying.
- [ ] Music is annoying and too loud by default.
- [ ] Engine texture issue (thruster is full black, thruster_0 have some dark gray parts in addition to black ones).
- [ ] Help menu mouse wheel is not "blocked", camera get the input too.
- [ ] Camera can rotate and "see" under the ground.

- [ ] Fix trajectory after deserialization. It is probably necessary to just call 'launch'.
- [ ] Make dynamic objects destroyed if going under the ground. It happens when flying too fast and the game cannot build collision volumes quick enough.
- [ ] Make an explosion object when dynamic body blows up.
- [ ] Make connection nodes for static bodies.
- [ ] Make it possible for the player to create a "construction base" used for attaching static bodies to it.
- [ ] Make it only possible to connect static bodies to "construction base" static node.
- [ ] Make it save/destroy/create/restore based on the bounding volume. May be introduce asynchronous database for this purpose.
- [ ] Resource system. May be "material" and "electricity"...
- [ ] Make "levels" purchasable for "material" resource.
- [ ] May be port to Godot 4.
- [ ] If port to Godot 4 is successful, try implement multiplayer.
- [ ] Make it possible to pick a character.
- [ ] Implement space suit on/off capability.

- [ ] Make volumes editable. Implement nodes hierarchy. Make it possible to drag/rotate the nodes and update the resulting landscape. May be implement a mode when it is possible to add/remove volumes and design landscape this way.
