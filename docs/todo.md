Here is the battle plan.
- [x] This might not be needed. Make atmosphere mesh per planet.
- [x] Vegetation and other static assets placement based on surface quad-tree node Ids.
- [x] Replace heightmap planets with voxel ones by employing dual grid marching cubes algorithm.
- [ ] Model more vegetation entities in order to make environment more attractive.
- [ ] Textures alignment in materials for planets. Beat the floating point rounding problem by using a common origin vector and have all other points as displacements with respect that origin one.
- [ ] Add more planets.
