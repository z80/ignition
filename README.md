Here is the battle plan.
- [x] Save.
- In process.
- [x] Save and Load.
- [x] Orbiting time acceleration.
- [x] Physics time acceleration Engine.time_scale = xxx.
- [ ] Make player characters to get in/out a habitat module.
- [ ] Trajectory visualization. In a separate viewport???
- [x] Continuous scale application on every frame and recomputing the landscape on indication. Now it is both applied when needed and on every rf jump.
- [x] Apply scaler on every visual frame. It is especially needed for celestial bodies. Pitching up edges do look weird.
- [ ] Port over the air friction model using mesh traingles.
- [ ] Vegetation and other static assets placement based on surface quad-tree node Ids.
