A game development inspired by Kerbal Space Program (KSP). Making something is more interesting than just playing a ready to use one, right?

## Features

One can build rockets of parts and fly to space.

Orbits are idealized Kepler orbits.

Physical interaction is computed sumultaneously in all places where rocker parts or players are. So no parts disappear if too far from the current vehicle controlled.
