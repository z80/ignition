Here is the battle plan.
- [ ] Save.
- In process.
- [ ] Save and Load.
- [ ] Orbiting time acceleration.
- [ ] Physics time acceleration OS.time_scale = xxx.
- [ ] Make player characters to get in/out a habitat module.
- [ ] Trajectory visualization. In a separate viewport???
- [ ] Continuous scale application on every frame and recomputing the landscape on indication. Now it is both applied when needed and on every rf jump.
- [x] Apply scaler on every visual frame. It is especially needed for celestial bodies. Pitching up edges do look weird.
- [ ] Port over the air friction model using mesh traingles.
