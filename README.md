Here is the battle plan.
- [x] Save.
- In process.
- [x] Save and Load.
- [x] Orbiting time acceleration.
- [x] Physics time acceleration Engine.time_scale = xxx.
- [x] Make player characters to get in/out a habitat module.
- [ ] Trajectory visualization. In a separate viewport??? For planets and for the controlled vehicle.
- [ ] May be rework a little bit how planet meshes are generated. When it is a distant mode, no need to apply heightmap, only apply color. And make sure it easily works for test projects, i.e. doesn't require complicated setup to actually see something.
- [x] Continuous scale application on every frame and recomputing the landscape on indication. Now it is both applied when needed and on every rf jump.
- [x] Apply scaler on every visual frame. It is especially needed for celestial bodies. Pitching up edges do look weird.
- [ ] Port over the air friction model using mesh traingles.
- [ ] Vegetation and other static assets placement based on surface quad-tree node Ids.
