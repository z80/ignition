	<brief_description>
		Editor-only node for defining a collision polygon in 3D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Allows editing a concave or convex collision polygon's vertices on a selected plane. Can also set a depth perpendicular to that plane. This class is only available in the editor. It will not appear in the scene tree at run-time. Creates several [ConvexPolygonShape3D]s at run-time to represent the original polygon using convex decomposition.
		[b]Note:[/b] Since this is an editor-only helper, properties modified during gameplay will have no effect.
		[b]Warning:[/b] A non-uniformly scaled CollisionPolygon3D node will probably not function as expected. Please make sure to keep its scale uniform (i.e. the same on all axes), and change its [member polygon]'s vertices instead.

			The collision margin for the generated [Shape3D]. See [member Shape3D.margin] for more details.

			Array of vertices which define the polygon.
			[b]Note:[/b] The returned value is a copy of the original. Methods which mutate the size or properties of the return value will not impact the original polygon. To change properties of the polygon, assign it to a temporary variable and make changes before reassigning the [code]polygon[/code] member.
