		An instance of a [NavigationMesh].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		An instance of a [NavigationMesh]. It tells the [Navigation] node what can be navigated and what cannot, based on the [NavigationMesh] resource.
		By default this node will register to the default [World] navigation map. If this node is a child of a [Navigation] node it will register to the navigation map of the navigation node.
		Two regions can be connected to each other if they share a similar edge. You can set the minimum distance between two vertices required to connect two edges by using [method NavigationServer.map_set_edge_connection_margin].
		[b]Note:[/b] Overlapping two regions' navmeshes is not enough for connecting two regions. They must share a similar edge.
		The cost of entering this region from another region can be controlled with the [member enter_cost] value.
		[b]Note:[/b] This value is not added to the path cost when the start position is already inside this region.
		The cost of traveling distances inside this region can be controlled with the [member travel_cost] multiplier.

	<methods>
		<method name="bake_navigation_mesh">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="on_thread" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Bakes the [NavigationMesh]. If [code]on_thread[/code] is set to [code]true[/code] (default), the baking is done on a separate thread. Baking on separate thread is useful because navigation baking is not a cheap operation. When it is completed, it automatically sets the new [NavigationMesh]. Please note that baking on separate thread may be very slow if geometry is parsed from meshes as async access to each mesh involves heavy synchronization. Also, please note that baking on a separate thread is automatically disabled on operating systems that cannot use threads (such as HTML5 with threads disabled).

		<method name="get_region_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this region on the [NavigationServer]. Combined with [method NavigationServer.map_get_closest_point_owner] can be used to identify the [NavigationMeshInstance] closest to a point on the merged navigation map.
