	<brief_description>
		Adds a Compressor audio effect to an Audio bus.
		Reduces sounds that exceed a certain threshold level, smooths out the dynamics and increases the overall volume.

		Dynamic range compressor reduces the level of the sound when the amplitude goes over a certain threshold in Decibels. One of the main uses of a compressor is to increase the dynamic range by clipping as little as possible (when sound goes over 0dB).
		Compressor has many uses in the mix:
		- In the Master bus to compress the whole output (Although a [AudioEffectLimiter] is probably better)
		- In voice channels to ensure they sound as balanced as possible.
		- Sidechained. Sidechained, which can reduce the sound level sidechained with another audio bus for threshold detection.. This technique is very common in video game mixing to download the level of Music/SFX while voices are being heard.
		- Accentuates transients by using a wider attack, making effects sound more punchy.
