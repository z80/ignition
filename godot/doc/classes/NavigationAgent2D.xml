		2D Agent used in navigation for collision avoidance.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		2D Agent that is used in navigation to reach a position while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. The dynamic obstacles are avoided using RVO collision avoidance. The agent needs navigation data to work correctly. [NavigationAgent2D] is physics safe.
		[b]Note:[/b] After setting [member target_position] it is required to use the [method get_next_path_position] function once every physics frame to update the internal path logic of the NavigationAgent. The returned vector position from this function should be used as the next movement position for the agent's parent Node.

	<methods>
		<method name="distance_to_target" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the distance to the target position, using the agent's global position. The user must set [member target_position] in order for this to be accurate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedVector2Array" />
			<description>
				Returns this agent's current path from start to finish in global coordinates. The path only updates when the target position is changed or the agent requires a repath. The path array is not intended to be used in direct path movement as the agent has its own internal path logic that would get corrupted by changing the path array manually. Use the intended [method get_next_path_position] once every physics frame to receive the next path point for the agents movement as this function also updates the internal path logic.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path_index" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns which index the agent is currently on in the navigation path's [PackedVector2Array].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_result" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="NavigationPathQueryResult2D" />
			<description>
				Returns the path query result for the path the agent is currently following.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_final_position">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns the reachable final position in global coordinates. This can change if the navigation path is altered in any way. Because of this, it would be best to check this each frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_layer_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified layer of the [member navigation_layers] bitmask is enabled, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_map" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of the navigation map for this NavigationAgent node. This function returns always the map set on the NavigationAgent node and not the map of the abstract agent on the NavigationServer. If the agent map is changed directly with the NavigationServer API the NavigationAgent node will not be aware of the map change. Use [method set_navigation_map] to change the navigation map for the NavigationAgent and also update the agent on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_next_path_position">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns the next position in global coordinates that can be moved to, making sure that there are no static objects in the way. If the agent does not have a navigation path, it will return the position of the agent's parent. The use of this function once every physics frame is required to update the internal path logic of the NavigationAgent.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this agent on the [NavigationServer2D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_navigation_finished">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns true if the navigation path's final position has been reached.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reachable">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns true if [member target_position] is reachable.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reached" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns true if [member target_position] is reached. It may not always be possible to reach the target position. It should always be possible to reach the final position though. See [method get_final_position].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_layer_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified layer in the [member navigation_layers] bitmask, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_map">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="navigation_map" type="RID" />
			<description>
				Sets the [RID] of the navigation map this NavigationAgent node should use and also updates the [code]agent[/code] on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_velocity">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="velocity" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Sends the passed in velocity to the collision avoidance algorithm. It will adjust the velocity to avoid collisions. Once the adjustment to the velocity is complete, it will emit the [signal velocity_computed] signal.
			</description>
		</method>

	<members>
		<member name="avoidance_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_avoidance_enabled" getter="get_avoidance_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code] the agent is registered for an RVO avoidance callback on the [NavigationServer2D]. When [method NavigationAgent2D.set_velocity] is used and the processing is completed a [code]safe_velocity[/code] Vector2 is received with a signal connection to [signal velocity_computed]. Avoidance processing with many registered agents has a significant performance cost and should only be enabled on agents that currently require it.

			The distance threshold before a path point is considered to be reached. This will allow an agent to not have to hit a path point on the path exactly, but in the area. If this value is set to high the NavigationAgent will skip points on the path which can lead to leaving the navigation mesh.
