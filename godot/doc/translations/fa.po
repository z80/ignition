"A* (A star) is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and "
"graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices "
"(points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys "
"widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* "
"implementation uses points in three-dimensional space and Euclidean "
"distances by default.\n"
"You must add points manually with [method add_point] and create segments "
"manually with [method connect_points]. Then you can test if there is a path "
"between two points with the [method are_points_connected] function, get a "
"path containing indices by [method get_id_path], or one containing actual "
"coordinates with [method get_point_path].\n"
"It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class "
"that extends [code]AStar[/code] and override methods [method _compute_cost] "
"and [method _estimate_cost]. Both take two indices and return a length, as "

"    func _estimate_cost(u, v):\n"
"        return min(0, abs(u - v) - 1)\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"[method _estimate_cost] should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. "
"[code]_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)[/code]. This serves as a "
"hint to the algorithm because the custom [code]_compute_cost[/code] might be "
"computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make [method _estimate_cost] "
"return the same value as [method _compute_cost] to provide the algorithm "
"with the most accurate information.\n"
"If the default [method _estimate_cost] and [method _compute_cost] methods "

"bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost "

"Dictionary type. Associative container which contains values referenced by "

"dictionary. In other programming languages, this data structure is sometimes "
"referred to as a hash map or associative array.\n"
"You can define a dictionary by placing a comma-separated list of [code]key: "
"value[/code] pairs in curly braces [code]{}[/code].\n"
"Erasing elements while iterating over them [b]is not supported[/b] and will "
"result in undefined behavior.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Dictionaries are always passed by reference. To get a copy of a "

"another_dict = {\n"

"[/codeblock]\n"

"the above example, [code]points_dict[\"White\"][/code] will return [code]50[/"

"Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of "
"another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any "
"number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct "
"children of a node) should have unique names.\n"
"A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk "
"and then instanced into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility "
"in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.\n"
"[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a "
"node is added to the scene tree, it receives the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback "
"is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i."
"e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered "
"before its child's.\n"
"Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_READY] notification and their respective [method _ready] "
"callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback "
"is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the "
"parent nodes.\n"
"This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order "
"will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method "
"_enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally "
"[method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).\n"
"[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the \"process\" state, so that they "
"receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). "
"Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method "
"set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame "
"rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] (in seconds) is passed as an "
"argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled "
"with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per "
"second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics "
"engine.\n"
"Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] "
"function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many "
"cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the "
"[method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the "
"input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), "
"ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.\n"
"To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into "
"other scenes), an \"owner\" can be set for the node with the [member owner] "
"property. This keeps track of who instanced what. This is mostly useful when "
"writing editors and tools, though.\n"
"Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method "
"queue_free], it will also free all its children.\n"
"[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy "
"to manage, you could create groups like \"enemies\" or \"collectables\" for "
"example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method "
"is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes "
"in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the "
"methods on [SceneTree].\n"
"[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, "
"see [NetworkedMultiplayerENet]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC "
"(remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling "
"[method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all "
"connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). "
"To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] "
"(make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the "
"high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos."

"This method has slightly different behavior based on whether the "

"If [code]blocking[/code] is [code]true[/code], the Godot thread will pause "

"[codeblock]\n"
"var regex = RegEx.new()\n"
"regex.compile(\"\\\\w-(\\\\d+)\")\n"

"This is the most important function in the whole portal culling system. "
"Without it, the system cannot function.\n"
"First it goes through every [Room] that is a child of the [code]room list[/"
"code] node (and [RoomGroup]s within) and converts and adds it to the "
"[code]room graph[/code].\n"
"This works for both [Room] nodes, and [Spatial] nodes that follow a special "
"naming convention. They should begin with the prefix [i]'Room_'[/i], "
"followed by the name you wish to give the room, e.g. [i]'Room_lounge'[/i]. "
"This will automatically convert such [Spatial]s to [Room] nodes for you. "
"This is useful if you want to build you entire room system in e.g. Blender, "
"and reimport multiple times as you work on the level.\n"
"The conversion will try to assign [VisualInstance]s that are children and "
"grandchildren of the [Room] to the room. These should be given a suitable "
"[code]portal mode[/code] (see the [CullInstance] documentation). The default "
"[code]portal mode[/code] is [code]STATIC[/code] - objects which are not "
"expected to move while the level is played, which will typically be most "
"objects.\n"
"The conversion will usually use the geometry of these [VisualInstance]s (and "
"the [Portal]s) to calculate a convex hull bound for the room. These bounds "
"will be shown in the editor with a wireframe. Alternatively you can specify "
"a manual custom bound for any room, see the [Room] documentation.\n"
"By definition, [Camera]s within a room can see everything else within the "
"room (that is one advantage to using convex hulls). However, in order to see "
"from one room into adjacent rooms, you must place [Portal]s, which represent "
"openings that the camera can see through, like windows and doors.\n"
"[Portal]s are really just specialized [MeshInstance]s. In fact you will "
"usually first create a portal by creating a [MeshInstance], especially a "
"[code]plane[/code] mesh instance. You would move the plane in the editor to "
"cover a window or doorway, with the front face pointing outward from the "
"room. To let the conversion process know you want this mesh to be a portal, "
"again we use a special naming convention. [MeshInstance]s to be converted to "
"a [Portal] should start with the prefix [i]'Portal_'[/i].\n"
"You now have a choice - you can leave the name as [i]'Portal_'[/i] and allow "
"the system to automatically detect the nearest [Room] to link. In most cases "
"this will work fine.\n"
"An alternative method is to specify the [Room] to link to manually, "
"appending a suffix to the portal name, which should be the name of the room "
"you intend to link to. For example [i]'Portal_lounge'[/i] will attempt to "
"link to the room named [i]'Room_lounge'[/i].\n"
"There is a special case here - Godot does not allow two nodes to share the "
"same name. What if you want to manually have more than one portal leading "
"into the same room? Surely they will need to both be called, e.g. "
"[i]'Portal_lounge'[/i]?\n"
"The solution is a wildcard character. After the room name, if you use the "
"character [i]'*'[/i], this character and anything following it will be "
"ignored. So you can use for example [i]'Portal_lounge*0'[/i], "
"[i]'Portal_lounge*1'[/i] etc.\n"
"Note that [Portal]s that have already been converted to [Portal] nodes "
"(rather than [MeshInstance]s) still need to follow the same naming "
"convention, as they will be relinked each time during conversion.\n"
"It is recommended that you only place objects in rooms that are desired to "
"stay within those rooms - i.e. [code]portal mode[/code]s [code]STATIC[/code] "
"or [code]DYNAMIC[/code] (not crossing portals). [code]GLOBAL[/code] and "

"is used to give impulse to a character. When working with 3D animations, a "
"popular technique is for animators to use the root skeleton bone to give "
"motion to the rest of the skeleton. This allows animating characters in a "
"way where steps actually match the floor below. It also allows precise "
"interaction with objects during cinematics. See also [AnimationTree].\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] [RootMotionView] is only visible in the editor. It will be "
"hidden automatically in the running project, and will also be converted to a "
"plain [Node] in the running project. This means a script attached to a "
"[RootMotionView] node [i]must[/i] have [code]extends Node[/code] instead of "
"[code]extends RootMotionView[/code]. Additionally, it must not be a "

"Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be "
"interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-"
"betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] "
"and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.\n"
"[Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't "
"know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-"
"chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween] node; it would be "
"difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node.\n"
"Here is a brief usage example that makes a 2D node move smoothly between two "
"positions:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_node(\"Tween\")\n"
"tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, \"position\",\n"
"        Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,\n"
"        Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)\n"
"tween.start()\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Many methods require a property name, such as [code]\"position\"[/code] "
"above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property "
"in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly "
"by using [code]\"property:component\"[/code] (e.g. [code]position:x[/code]), "
"where it would only apply to that particular component.\n"
"Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/"
"code]. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to "
"the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings."
"net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum "
"EaseType] constant, and controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is "
"applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you "
"don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum "
"TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that "
"looks best.\n"

"immersive-web.github.io/webxr-gamepads-module/#xr-standard-gamepad-"
"mapping]Section 3.3 of the WebXR Gamepads Module[/url].\n"
"- Using [method Node._unhandled_input] and [InputEventJoypadButton] or "
"[InputEventJoypadMotion]. This works the same as normal joypads, except the "
"[member InputEvent.device] starts at 100, so the left controller is 100 and "

"[url=https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-gamepads-module/#xr-standard-"
"gamepad-mapping]Section 3.3 of the WebXR Gamepads Module[/url].\n"
"- Using the [signal select], [signal squeeze] and related signals. This "
"method will work for both advanced VR controllers, and non-traditional "
"\"controllers\" like a tap on the screen, a spoken voice command or a button "
"press on the device itself. The [code]controller_id[/code] passed to these "
"signals is the same id as used in [member ARVRController.controller_id].\n"
"You can use one or all of these methods to allow your game or app to support "
"a wider or narrower set of devices and input methods, or to allow more "
"advanced interations with more advanced devices."
