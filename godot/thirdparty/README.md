# Third party libraries


## b2d_convexdecomp

- Upstream: https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D/tree/master/Contributions/Utilities/ConvexDecomposition
- Version: git (25615e0, 2015) with modifications
- License: zlib

The files were adapted to Godot by removing the dependency on b2Math (replacing
it by b2Glue.h) and commenting out some verbose printf calls.
Upstream code has not changed in 10 years, no need to keep track of changes.

Important: Some files have Godot-made changes.
They are marked with `// -- GODOT start --` and `// -- GODOT end --`
comments.


## bullet

- Upstream: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
- Version: 2.88
- License: zlib

Files extracted from upstream source:

- src/* apart from CMakeLists.txt and premake4.lua files
- LICENSE.txt


## certs

- Upstream: Mozilla, via https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ca-certificates
- Version: 2018.2.26
- License: MPL 2.0

File extracted from a recent Fedora install:
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem
(It can't be extracted directly from the package,
as it's generated on the user's system.)


## cvtt

- Upstream: https://github.com/elasota/cvtt
- Version: 1.0.0-beta4
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .cpp, .h, and .txt files in ConvectionKernels/


## enet

- Upstream: http://enet.bespin.org
- Version: 1.3.13
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .c files in the main directory (except unix.c win32.c)
- the include/enet/ folder as enet/ (except unix.h win32.h)
- LICENSE file

Important: enet.h, host.c, protocol.c have been slightly modified
to be usable by godot socket implementation and allow IPv6.
Two files (godot.cpp and enet/godot.h) have been added to provide
enet socket implementation using Godot classes.
It is still possible to build against a system wide ENet but doing so
will limit it's functionality to IPv4 only.
Check the diff of enet.h, protocol.c, and host.c with the 1.3.13
tarball before the next update.
