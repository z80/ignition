# Third party libraries


## assimp

- Upstream: http://github.com/assimp/assimp
- Version: git (308db73d0b3c2d1870cd3e465eaa283692a4cf23, 2019)
- License: BSD-3-Clause

Files extracted from upstream source:

- Run `cmake .` in root folder to generate files
- `code/{CApi,Common,FBX,Material,PostProcessing}/`
- `contrib/utf8cpp/source/`
- `include/`

## bullet

- Upstream: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
- Version: 2.89
- License: zlib

Files extracted from upstream source:

- src/* apart from CMakeLists.txt and premake4.lua files
- LICENSE.txt


## certs

- Upstream: Mozilla, via https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ca-certificates
- Version: 2018.2.26
- License: MPL 2.0

File extracted from a recent Fedora install:
/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem
(It can't be extracted directly from the package,
as it's generated on the user's system.)


## cvtt

- Upstream: https://github.com/elasota/cvtt
- Version: 1.0.0-beta4
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .cpp, .h, and .txt files in ConvectionKernels/


## enet

- Upstream: http://enet.bespin.org
- Version: 1.3.15 (224f31101fc60939c02f6bbe8e8fc810a7db306b, 2020)
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .c files in the main directory (except unix.c win32.c)
- the include/enet/ folder as enet/ (except unix.h win32.h)
- LICENSE file

Important: enet.h, host.c, protocol.c have been slightly modified
to be usable by godot socket implementation and allow IPv6 and DTLS.
Apply the patches in the `patches/` folder when syncing on newer upstream
commits.

Two files (godot.cpp and enet/godot.h) have been added to provide
enet socket implementation using Godot classes.

It is still possible to build against a system wide ENet but doing so
will limit its functionality to IPv4 only.
