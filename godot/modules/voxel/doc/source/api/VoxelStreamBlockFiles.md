# VoxelStreamBlockFiles

Inherits: [VoxelStream](VoxelStream.md)


Loads and saves blocks as individual files under a directory.

## Description: 

Loads and saves blocks to the filesystem, under a directory. Each block gets its own file, which may produce a lot of them. This is a naive implementation and may be very slow in practice. At the very least it serves as proof of concept, but will probably be removed in the future.

## Properties: 


Type      | Name                       | Default 
--------- | -------------------------- | --------
`String`  | [directory](#i_directory)  | ""
