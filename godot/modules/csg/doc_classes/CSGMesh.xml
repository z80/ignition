		A CSG Mesh shape that uses a mesh resource.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This CSG node allows you to use any mesh resource as a CSG shape, provided it is closed, does not self-intersect, does not contain internal faces and has no edges that connect to more then two faces.

			The [Mesh] resource to use as a CSG shape.
			[b]Note:[/b] When using an [ArrayMesh], avoid meshes with vertex normals unless a flat shader is required. By default, CSGMesh will ignore the mesh's vertex normals and use a smooth shader calculated using the faces' normals. If a flat shader is required, ensure that all faces' vertex normals are parallel.
