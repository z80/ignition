/*<h2>atmosphere/demo/demo.glsl</h2>

<p>This GLSL fragment shader is used to render our demo scene, which consists of
a sphere S on a purely spherical planet P. It is rendered by "ray tracing", i.e.
the vertex shader outputs the view ray direction, and the fragment shader
computes the intersection of this ray with the spheres S and P to produce the
final pixels. The fragment shader also computes the intersection of the light
rays with the sphere S, to compute shadows, as well as the intersections of the
view ray with the shadow volume of S, in order to compute light shafts.

<p>Our fragment shader has the following inputs and outputs:

<p>The functions to compute shadows and light shafts must be defined before we
can use them in the main shader function, so we define them first. Testing if
a point is in the shadow of the sphere S is equivalent to test if the
corresponding light ray intersects the sphere, which is very simple to do.
However, this is only valid for a punctual light source, which is not the case
of the Sun. In the following function we compute an approximate (and biased)
soft shadow by taking the angular size of the Sun into account:
*/

<p>To compute light shafts we need the intersections of the view ray with the
shadow volume of the sphere S. Since the Sun is not a punctual light source this
shadow volume is not a cylinder but a cone (for the umbra, plus another cone for
the penumbra, but we ignore it here):

<p>Noting, as in the above figure, $\bp$ the camera position, $\bv$ and $\bs$
the unit view ray and sun direction vectors and $R$ the sphere radius (supposed
to be centered on the origin), the point at distance $d$ from the camera is
$\bq=\bp+d\bv$. This point is at a distance $\delta=-\bq\cdot\bs$ from the
sphere center along the umbra cone axis, and at a distance $r$ from this axis
given by $r^2=\bq\cdot\bq-\delta^2$. Finally, at distance $\delta$ along the
axis the umbra cone has radius $\rho=R-\delta\tan\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is
the Sun's angular radius. The point at distance $d$ from the camera is on the
shadow cone only if $r^2=\rho^2$, i.e. only if
\begin{equation}
(\bp+d\bv)\cdot(\bp+d\bv)-((\bp+d\bv)\cdot\bs)^2=
(R+((\bp+d\bv)\cdot\bs)\tan\alpha)^2
\end{equation}
Developping this gives a quadratic equation for $d$:
\begin{equation}
ad^2+2bd+c=0
\end{equation}
where
<ul>
<li>$a=1-l(\bv\cdot\bs)^2$,</li>
<li>$b=\bp\cdot\bv-l(\bp\cdot\bs)(\bv\cdot\bs)-\tan(\alpha)R(\bv\cdot\bs)$,</li>
<li>$c=\bp\cdot\bp-l(\bp\cdot\bs)^2-2\tan(\alpha)R(\bp\cdot\bs)-R^2$,</li>
<li>$l=1+\tan^2\alpha$</li>
</ul>
From this we deduce the two possible solutions for $d$, which must be clamped to
the actual shadow part of the mathematical cone (i.e. the slab between the
sphere center and the cone apex or, in other words, the points for which
$\delta$ is between $0$ and $R/\tan\alpha$). The following function implements
these equations:

/*<h3>Main shading function</h3>

<p>Using these functions we can now implement the main shader function, which
computes the radiance from the scene for a given view ray. This function first
tests if the view ray intersects the sphere S. If so it computes the sun and
sky light received by the sphere at the intersection point, combines this with
the sphere BRDF and the aerial perspective between the camera and the sphere.
It then does the same with the ground, i.e. with the planet sphere P, and then
computes the sky radiance and transmittance. Finally, all these terms are
composited together (an opacity is also computed for each object, using an
approximate view cone - sphere intersection factor) to get the final radiance.

<p>We start with the computation of the intersections of the view ray with the
shadow volume of the sphere, because they are needed to get the aerial
perspective for the sphere and the planet:
